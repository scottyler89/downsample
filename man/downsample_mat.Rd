\title{Downsample columns of a matrix}
\usage{
downsample_mat(in_mat, target_depth = NULL)
}
\arguments{
\item{in_mat}{An input matrix}

\item{target_depth}{This can either be nothing or a}
}
\value{
A matrix of the downsampled in_mat
}
\description{
This function takes in a matrix of counts & will downsample 
each column such that their colSums are equivalent. Note that you can't just
randomly subtract 1 from cells until they're equivalent. To recapitulate the
actual biases from Poisson sampling, we actually create the "bag of marbles"
and sample each until we get the the target depth. You can either pass in 
the target depth, or if not, it will be automatically set to the minimum of 
the colSums, or if you are doing an integration & want to downsample 
different datasets, you should first FILTER OUT the columns whose colSums 
are less than the cutoff, then set this value to the cutoff.
